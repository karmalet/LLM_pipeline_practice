根据前提"text"，发言人指出美方指责中国政府泄露信息是没有根据的，这属于污蔑。因此，无法确定"hypothesis"是否成立，因为 premise 中并未明确中国政府确实有此行为。

"answer": "U"

reasoning: The premise indicates that the U.S. is accusing China without evidence, which is a form of slander. However, this does not necessarily confirm or deny whether the Chinese government actually leaked information.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Text Analysis**: The speaker accuses the U.S. of falsely blaming China for leaking information, calling it an "unfounded accusation."
2. **Understanding Slander**: This means that the U.S. is spreading false claims against China.
3. **Determining Factuality**: Since the text does not provide evidence that the Chinese government actually leaked information, we cannot confirm or deny the hypothesis.

**Answer**: U
